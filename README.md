podspy: A SciKit for process oriented data science

This is an attempt to nicely package some of the 1s and 0s from my personal code.

Recently, a much grander effort has been put to create a python package for process mining - [pm4py](http://pm4py.org/), check it out!!

Features
---
- Log processing and manipulation of event logs in XES format
- Petri nets (system nets, inhibitor and reset nets) and visualization

Installation
